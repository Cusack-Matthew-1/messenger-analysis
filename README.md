## Facebook Messenger Messages Analysis

An absolute mouthful, I know.

The purpose of this project is to create a program that can allow a user to perform interesting and insightful analysis into their Facebook messenger data, without having to jump through lots and lots of programming hoops.
This is a project I have attempted many times in a past few years, but I've only really managed to make meaningful progress recently.

# Current Features

Currently the program is capable of turning a jumble of .json files into a single .csv file, and then counting the number of messages exchanged per day. It can also generate a rolling average for this data and display it on the same graph as the unaveraged data. 

# Future Features

1. Analyse the % of messages sent per person
2. Analyse how the % of messages sent per person changes over time
3. Analyse how the number of messages sent relates to time of the day
4. Analyse the content of the messages; most common words, phrases etc 
5. Emoji analysis?
6. Display multiple sets of data on a single graph (e.g messages shared with 2,3 + people per day graph)
